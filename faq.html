                <h3>Installing and launching Beaker</h3>

                <p><strong>Can I change the heap size for Groovy?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes. To customize the heap size, launch Beaker like this:</p>
                <p><code>beaker.command  --plugin-option Groovy:-Xmx8g</code></p>

                <p><strong>Can I make the server accessible across the net?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes.  Start it like this:</p>
                <p><code>beaker.command --public-server</code></p>
                <p>The server will generate a password for you, and
                print it on the console.  Connect to the printed URL
                (note that it will be HTTPS, meaning encryption is
                used to prevent snooping) and enter the password.</p>

                <p><strong>How do I give command-line options on the Mac?</strong></p>
                <p>Using the terminal, the contents of the app are
                visible.  Assuming you have it installed in the normal
                location you can run it like this:</p>
                <p><code>/Applications/Beaker.app/Contents/Resources/dist/beaker.command --help</code></p>

                <h3>General</h3>

                <p><strong>Can I customize my default notebook?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, create a notebook you like and save it to
                ~/.beaker/v1/config/default.bkr. This will be loaded
                whenever you click 'new notebook.'</p>

                <p><strong>What other customization or init files are there?</strong></p>
                <p>~/.beaker/v1/config/beaker.pref.json is read at
                startup and can modify the UI in many ways.  See
                <a href=https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Configuration-and-Preference>its
                documentation</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Why are you asking for my email address?</strong></p>
                <p>The primary purpose of the beta is to get user
                feedback on what needs to be improved before our full
                launch. We may ask you to complete a short
                questionnaire about your experience. We may also
                notify you when we make a major new release, or in
                case of an important security update.</p>

                <p>You can unsubscribe from our email list at any time and continue using Beaker.</p>

                <p><strong>How does Beaker relate to the IPython Notebook?</strong></p>
                <p>If you only work in Python, you can consider Beaker
                an alternative UI to IPython. Our Python plugin runs
                an IPython kernel on the backend, so all of your code
                should work the way you expect it to. We have some UI
                features that we find compelling, so check it out!</p>

                <p>If you work with multiple languages, or one
                language that isn't Python, we think you'll find
                Beaker much more pleasant. Beaker's core was built to
                be language agnostic, so all languages are treated
                equally within Beaker.</p>

                <p>Since several of our plugins (Python, Julia, Ruby)
                are based on IPython kernels, we've been able to spend
                our time working on Beaker's UI and our other
                plugins. Many thanks to IPython for their great kernel
                architecture!</p>
